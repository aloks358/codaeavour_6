### **Product Cycle Plan for a Team of 3**

The development will follow an **Agile** approach with **two-week sprints** and regular check-ins. Here's the detailed breakdown of the tasks, roles, and timelines for the team of 3 members:

#### **Team Roles**:
1. **Frontend Developer**: Focuses on building the UI (React.js) and integrating it with the backend API.
2. **Backend Developer**: Builds the API (Node.js + Express), handles real-time communication (Socket.io), and manages database interactions (PostgreSQL + Sequelize).
3. **DevOps/Full-Stack Developer**: Responsible for setting up Docker, deployment pipelines, and managing infrastructure on AWS. Also assists with backend/frontend tasks.

### **Development Phases and Timeline**:

#### **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core API Development (Weeks 1-2)**
- **Backend Developer**:
  - Set up **Node.js + Express** project structure.
  - Implement **authentication API** (JWT-based).
  - Create **database schema** with Sequelize (Users, Teams, Submissions, Grades, Events).
  
- **Frontend Developer**:
  - Set up **React.js** project.
  - Design basic layout (login page, dashboard skeleton).
  
- **DevOps**:
  - Set up **Docker** for local development.
  - Configure **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** in Docker.

#### **Phase 2: Submissions & Grading System (Weeks 3-4)**
- **Backend Developer**:
  - Implement **submission API** (file uploads, project descriptions).
  - Implement **grading API** (submit grades, fetch grades).
  
- **Frontend Developer**:
  - Create the **submission form** and integrate it with the submission API.
  - Build the **grading interface** and connect it to the grading API.

- **DevOps**:
  - Set up **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for deployment.
  - Integrate **S3** for file storage (for project uploads).

#### **Phase 3: Real-Time Notifications & Dashboard (Weeks 5-6)**
- **Backend Developer**:
  - Set up **Socket.io** for real-time notifications (new submissions, grading reminders).
  - Build **dashboard API** for fetching statistics (registrations, submissions, grading progress).

- **Frontend Developer**:
  - Implement the **dashboard UI** with **Chart.js** or **D3.js**.
  - Integrate real-time notifications with Socket.io.

- **DevOps**:
  - Optimize deployment for **real-time connections** (Socket.io, Redis).
  - Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy for secure access (SSL certificates).

#### **Phase 4: Winners List, Final Touches & Testing (Weeks 7-8)**
- **Backend Developer**:
  - Implement **winners list API**.
  - Write tests for core APIs (authentication, submissions, grading).

- **Frontend Developer**:
  - Implement **winners list UI** and connect it to the API.
  - Perform **frontend testing** and fix bugs.

- **DevOps**:
  - Finalize **deployment pipeline** and ensure automated testing.
  - Perform **load testing** for scalability.

#### **Phase 5: Final Testing & Launch (Week 9-10)**
- **All Members**:
  - Perform **end-to-end testing**.
  - Fix any bugs and optimize the performance.
  - Launch the portal to production.

---

### **Summary of Timelines**:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Backend setup, database schema, core API for authentication and submission. Frontend skeleton.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Complete submission and grading systems, integrate frontend forms.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Real-time notifications, build the dashboard.
- **Weeks 7-8**: Winners list, final API endpoints, testing.
- **Weeks 9-10**: End-to-end testing, bug fixes, and production launch.
